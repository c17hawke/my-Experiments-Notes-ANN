# Introduction to ANN

## ANN models were inspired from BNN.

To understand ANN one should know the basics of BNN. ANNs were first introduced by Warren McCulloh (Neuro)


## Why should we learn about ANN ?

!!! quote
    To understand brain you should build one

    - Lex Fridman 

Similarly to understand what we can do with ANN and why is it so important let's learn to build one.

Although ANN was inspired by BNN but still its quite different from that.
